In January 2005, during the confirmation hearings for the&nbsp;United States Secretary of State&nbsp;nominee&nbsp;Condoleezza Rice, Boxer challenged her to admit to alleged mistakes and false statements made by the Bush Administration in leading the United States into the&nbsp;2003 invasion of Iraq, and ultimately voted against confirmation, along with twelve other senators.&nbsp;The dissent was the highest vote against a Secretary of State nominee since 1825 when&nbsp;Henry Clay&nbsp;was so named. Boxer again voted aganist Boxer voted against&nbsp;John Bolton’s nomination for&nbsp;U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and&nbsp;filibustered&nbsp;him on the Senate floor. This was due to the strong&nbsp;Democratic&nbsp;opposition Bolton could not obtain Senate approval. However, President Bush bypassed the Senate by employing the constitutional right of&nbsp;recess appointment, only the second time such an appointment has been used for a&nbsp;United States ambassador to the United Nations&nbsp;since the UN’s founding in 1945. Recess appointments themselves have been used numerous times by various presidents.</p><p>Boxer voted against the confirmation of&nbsp;Chief Justice of the United States&nbsp;nominee&nbsp;John Roberts, and against the confirmation of&nbsp;Associate Justice&nbsp;nominee&nbsp;Samuel Alito. Boxer and&nbsp;John Ensign&nbsp; are the authors of the Invest in the USA Act. In October 2004, the legislation signed into law as a small part of the more comprehensive American Jobs Creation Act, is intended to encourage American companies to bring overseas profits back to the United States, to create jobs in the U.S., and stimulate domestic economic growth. In March 2004, Boxer offered an amendment to the Federal budget to create a $24 billion jobs reserve fund. The amendment would set aside funds for a variety of investments to improve the economy and create jobs by establishing a manufacturing jobs tax credit for companies that create jobs in the United States, expanding investment in science research and development, providing a tax credit to small businesses to pay for health insurance for their employees, and expanding trade adjustment assistance to help those who lose their jobs because of&nbsp;foreign trade. The Boxer amendment would also end the tax break that companies receive after moving plants overseas. On October 1, 2008,she voted in favor of the&nbsp;Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. In her vote against the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, she distinguished herself by being one of only eight members of the Senate to vote against the repeal.</p><p>On August 26, 2013, she told&nbsp;The Ed Show&nbsp;on&nbsp;MSNBC&nbsp;that the&nbsp;federal minimum wage&nbsp;should be raised to $10.00 an hour. She also established the Excellence in Education award to recognize teachers, parents, businesses and organizations that are working to make positive changes in education. Since 1997 she has presented the Excellence in Education Award to 38 recipients. In the 2002&nbsp;Help America Vote Act, she voted in support of it. The 2002&nbsp;Help America Vote Act mandated the use of voting machines across the country, among other provisions. On February 18, 2005, together with her colleges, introduced the Count Every Vote Act of 2005. The Count Every Vote Act would provide a voter verified paper ballot for every vote cast in&nbsp;electronic voting&nbsp;machines and ensure access to voter verification for all citizens. The bill mandates that this ballot be the official ballot for purposes of a recount. The bill sets a uniform standard for provisional ballots and requires the Federal Election Assistance Commission to issue standards that ensure uniform access to voting machines and trained election personnel in every community. The bill also mandated improved security measures for electronic voting machines.&nbsp;The bill did not pass. She opposed the&nbsp;nuclear energy&nbsp;deal between the United States and India. Boxer is of the opinion that India should not get help from the U.S. in the civilian nuclear energy sector until it breaks&nbsp;its relationship with Iran.</p><p>Boxer successfully led the 2003 Senate floor battle to block oil drilling in the&nbsp;Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&nbsp;In 2005, she voted again to block oil drilling at ANWR. Boxer has introduced the National Oceans Protection Act (NOPA) of 2005.&nbsp;Some of the provisions of this act are: strengthen ocean governance; protect and restore marine wildlife and habitats; address ocean pollution; improve fisheries management. The bill also addresses needs regarding marine science, research and technology,&nbsp;marine mammals, coastal development, and&nbsp;invasive species. She is also an original cosponsor of Senator&nbsp;Jim Jeffords’ (I-VT)&nbsp;Clean Power Act.&nbsp;This legislation would reduce emissions of three pollutants coming from power plants;&nbsp;sulfur dioxide,&nbsp;nitrogen oxides, and&nbsp;mercury, and also reduce emissions of&nbsp;carbon dioxide. As the new head of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in January 2007, Boxer wants to reduce energy consumption. She is attempting to curb&nbsp;global warmingby leading pilot programs. The few things that she and some of her fellow Senators are doing could cut electricity consumption by as much as 50 percent in their Capitol Hill offices. Senator Boxer was the Senate sponsor of the&nbsp;Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act, which was signed into law by President&nbsp;George W. Bush&nbsp;on October 17, 2006. The bill protected 275,830 acres (1,116&nbsp;km2) of federal land as&nbsp;wilderness&nbsp;and 21 miles (34&nbsp;km) of stream as a&nbsp;wild and scenic river, including such popular areas as the&nbsp;King Range&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cache Creek.&nbsp;Senator Boxer worked with Senator&nbsp;Dianne Feinstein&nbsp;and Representative&nbsp;Mike Thompson&nbsp;(the bill’s House sponsor) in a five-year effort to pass the legislation. Boxer along with her colleague Dianne Feinstein voted in favor of subsidy payments to conventional commodity farm producers at the cost of subsidies for conservation-oriented farming. In 1997, the Senate passed a Boxer resolution calling on the United States not to recognize the&nbsp;Taliban&nbsp;as the official government of&nbsp;Afghanistan&nbsp;because of its human rights abuses against women. In 2002, Boxer voted against the proposed&nbsp;US invasion of Iraq. She has subsequently referred to that vote as the best vote of her career. She also voted against the first&nbsp;Gulf War&nbsp;while a member of the House in 1991&nbsp;and was a very vocal protester against the Vietnam War in the 1970s.</p><p>She was a cosponsor of S. 495, or the&nbsp;Darfur Accountability Act of 2005, which would impose sanctions against perpetrators of&nbsp;crimes against humanity&nbsp;in&nbsp;Darfur. In 2012 she and other bipartisan group of six senators introduced a resolution condemning Russia for aiding&nbsp;Syrian President&nbsp;Bashar al-Assad’s government as the country&nbsp;faced civil war.&nbsp;In October 2002, Boxer voted against the&nbsp;joint resolution&nbsp;passed by the&nbsp;US Congress&nbsp;to authorize the use of military force by the Bush Administration against&nbsp;Iraq.&nbsp;In June 2005, Senators Boxer and&nbsp;Russ Feingold&nbsp;of Wisconsin, cosponsored Senate Resolution 171 calling for a timeframe for&nbsp;US troop withdrawal from Iraq. Her petition demanding an exit strategy from Iraq drew 107,218 signatures. She was sharply critical of US Army General&nbsp;David Petraeus’ testimony regarding the political and military situation of Iraq in 2007, charging him with reporting while wearing “rosy glasses”. She joined colleagues to pass a&nbsp;Federal ban&nbsp;on various&nbsp;semi-automatic firearms&nbsp;and established the COPS program. In the wake of the&nbsp;2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Boxer posted on Facebook that it was an “unspeakable tragedy.” She offered thoughts and prayers to victims and their families, as well as “common sense gun safety laws to protect our communities from these weapons of war.” She did not mention terrorism. She co-sponsored the&nbsp;Matthew Shepard Act,&nbsp;which expanded the federal definition of hate crimes to include crimes based on the victim’s&nbsp;sexual orientation&nbsp;and&nbsp;gender identity. She also joined with Senate Democratic women at a press conference to speak about women’s health.</p><p>She was part of a coalition to increase medical research to find cures for diseases. In 2007, she authored successful bipartisan legislation with Senator&nbsp;Gordon Smith&nbsp;to combat HIV/AIDS and&nbsp;tuberculosis&nbsp;globally.&nbsp;In 1997, she authored a Patients’ Bill of Rights. She has written a bill to make&nbsp;health insurance&nbsp;tax-deductible and one to let any American buy into the same health insurance program that members of Congress have. She supports comprehensive prescription drug coverage through&nbsp;Medicare&nbsp;and the right of all consumers to purchase lower-cost prescription drugs re-imported from Canada. In October 2002, she urged the&nbsp;Bush Administration&nbsp;to take specific steps to address the causes of the&nbsp;steep increase in autism&nbsp;cases in California.&nbsp;She wrote&nbsp;Health and Human Services&nbsp;(HHS)&nbsp;Secretary&nbsp;Tommy Thompson&nbsp;to establish a common national standard for the&nbsp;diagnosis of autism; instruct the CDC and the&nbsp;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry&nbsp;to convene a task force to review the current literature on autism and conduct its own study if necessary; and direct the&nbsp;National Institutes of Health&nbsp;(NIH) and the&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;(CDC) to work with the states to create a national chronic disease database. She is an advocate for embryonic&nbsp;stem-cell research, which has the potential to help those with&nbsp;diabetes,&nbsp;Parkinson’s disease,&nbsp;Alzheimer’s disease, spinal cord injuries, and other diseases. The&nbsp;Human Rights Campaign&nbsp;gave Boxer ratings of 100%, 88% and 100% for the&nbsp;107th,&nbsp;108th, and&nbsp;109th&nbsp;sessions of&nbsp;Congress, respectively, indicating a support of the HRC’s slate of pro-gay rights legislative issues.&nbsp;In 1996, she was one of fourteen Senators to vote against the&nbsp;Defense of Marriage Act&nbsp;and also voted against the&nbsp;Federal Marriage Amendment&nbsp;in 2004 and 2006,&nbsp;although when San Francisco Mayor&nbsp;Gavin Newsom&nbsp;issued a directive&nbsp;to the city-county clerk to issue&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;licenses to&nbsp;same-sex couplesshe stated that she supported&nbsp;California’s domestic partnership law&nbsp;but agreed with its definition that marriage was between a man and a woman.&nbsp;However, her 2010 re-election campaign website states that “Senator Boxer supports marriage equality.”&nbsp;She opposed&nbsp;Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that prohibited same-sex marriage in California, and supported the&nbsp;Uniting American Families Act. She has come out against reforming marijuana policy and is opposed to the California Ballot measure to legalize and tax marijuana for those 21 and older in the state. After the&nbsp;September 11, 2001 attacks, Boxer authored a bill to protect commercial airliners against attacks by shoulder-fired missiles, and wrote the law allowing airline pilots with special training to carry guns in the cockpit. She wrote the High-Tech Port Security Act, and sponsored the Chemical Security Act to address terrorist threats against chemical plants. Senator Boxer also cosponsored comprehensive rail security legislation. Boxer maintains a strong stance in support of&nbsp;reproductive rights&nbsp;and the&nbsp;pro-choice movement.</p><p>Boxer authored the&nbsp;Freedom of Choice Act&nbsp;of 2004 and participated in the floor fight for passage of the&nbsp;Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. She is also an original cosponsor of the Title X Family Planning Services Act of 2005, S.844, by Senator&nbsp;Hillary Clinton&nbsp;(D-NY). This legislation aims to improve access to women’s health care. It authorizes funding for&nbsp;family planning&nbsp;services grants; allows states to provide such services to individuals who may not be eligible for&nbsp;Medicaid; prohibits health insurance providers from excluding contraceptive services, drugs or devices from benefits; establishes a program to disseminate information on&nbsp;emergency contraception; requires hospitals receiving federal funding to offer emergency contraception to victims of&nbsp;sexual assault; provides grants to public and private entities to establish or expand teen pregnancy prevention programs; and requires that federally funded education programs about&nbsp;contraception&nbsp;be medically accurate and include information about health benefits and failure rates. She was strongly critical of the&nbsp;Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which would prevent taxpayer-funded abortions possibly resulting in women not being able to pay with their own funds for abortion coverage&nbsp;Affordable Health Care for America Act. She strongly supports the current system of&nbsp;Social Security, and opposed President&nbsp;George W. Bush’s plan for partial privatization of Social Security. In June 2008, she spoke in the Senate in opposition to the&nbsp;FISA Amendments Act of 2008,&nbsp;a pending bill in the United States Congress to amend the&nbsp;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,&nbsp;and later broke with her counterpart Sen.&nbsp;Dianne Feinstein&nbsp;and voted against it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=barbara-boxer-net-worth></span><span>Barbara Boxer Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She has an estimated net worth of $6 Million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=barbara-boxer-and-dianne-feinstein></span><span>Barbara Boxer And Dianne Feinstein</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In Sep. 27, 2017, 4:47 p.m, Barbara Boxer said if Sen. Dianne Feinstein runs for another term, she should expect a tough race.<br>It’s one of the hottest political parlor games in California right now: Will she run again? Everyone is waiting for Sen. Dianne Feinstein to announce if she’ll seek a sixth term. And even though they served as colleagues in Washington for more than two decades, former Sen. Barbara Boxer said she has no inside intel on what Feinstein will do in 2018. “I believe she is running until I see any other indication,” Boxer said Wednesday at a Sacramento Press Club lunch. “Every single race is hard…. Anyone who runs against her will give her a tough race.” Feinstein, 84, has made clear she is taking her time, even as ambitious politicians eye the seat she has held since 1992. One long-shot Democrat already is raising money for the race, and Feinstein recently drew criticism from California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, who has not ruled out a primary challenge against her. Boxer said Wednesday her own priority for next year’s midterm election is flipping several Republican-held House seats in Southern California. “There’s no such thing as an off election year,” she said. “It’s an on year.” Much of this work will be done through the political action committee Boxer founded, PAC for a Change. The organization also supports electing more Democrats to the Senate and standing up to President Trump’s policies, she said. Since leaving the Senate in January, Boxer has also given speeches and promoted her book, “The Art of Tough.” She doesn’t like to consider herself a retiree. Boxer also skirted a question about her pick for governor in a race that already is crowded with several Democrats. All of the candidates, she joked, are “like my sons and daughters.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=barbara-boxer-congressional-service></span><span>Barbara Boxer&nbsp;<span>Congressional Service</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fl66zrsCrmGaan62ys3nBoqagqpGltbp5wKCcZp6RoratxYysp6ito5p6rLXDrGSenKWYrrW1zqdkqaSRqbOwvsxmmKecXau8tbHSZpqaqpWav266xK1ksKeiqbVusMiapaedXZuyqrrSrZyipl2YvK%2Bz0Z6qrKGfo66tedKeqa%2Bhk5p8</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fbarbara-boxer-biography-age-family-spouse-kids-education-platform-and-votes-career-net-worth-dianne-feinstein-congressional-service.html&title=Barbara%20Boxer%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Kids%2c%20Education%2c%20Platform%20And%20Votes%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbarbara-boxer-biography-age-family-spouse-kids-education-platform-and-votes-career-net-worth-dianne-feinstein-congressional-service.html&description=Barbara%20Boxer%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Kids%2c%20Education%2c%20Platform%20And%20Votes%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbarbara-boxer-biography-age-family-spouse-kids-education-platform-and-votes-career-net-worth-dianne-feinstein-congressional-service.html&title=Barbara%20Boxer%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Kids%2c%20Education%2c%20Platform%20And%20Votes%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fbarbara-boxer-biography-age-family-spouse-kids-education-platform-and-votes-career-net-worth-dianne-feinstein-congressional-service.html&title=Barbara%20Boxer%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Kids%2c%20Education%2c%20Platform%20And%20Votes%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fbarbara-boxer-biography-age-family-spouse-kids-education-platform-and-votes-career-net-worth-dianne-feinstein-congressional-service.html&text=Barbara%20Boxer%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Kids%2c%20Education%2c%20Platform%20And%20Votes%2c%20Career%2c%20Net%20Worth" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fbarbara-boxer-biography-age-family-spouse-kids-education-platform-and-votes-career-net-worth-dianne-feinstein-congressional-service.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Aldo Pusey</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-01-29</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./hope-tala.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Hope Tala</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./best-way-to-make-uncrustables.html><h3>The Best Way To Make Uncrustables >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
